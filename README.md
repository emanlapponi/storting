# Storting
A repository for an ongoing collaberation project between the Department of Informatics and Department of Political Science, at the University of Oslo. The project aims at analyzing parliamentary debates from the Norwegian Storting in various ways. Our data builds on the brilliant work done by [Holder de ord](https://github.com/holderdeord).

## Status

### R
[2016-04-27] R code is now functional for producing metadata for the speeches. All scripts will run with "./R/" as root. The main script -- "./R/Scripts/wrap\_up.R" will produce the file [taler\_meta.csv](http://folk.uio.no/martigso/storting/). But, be aware that parts of this script, such as source call on "taler_prep.R", builds on external data; it will not work without these.
